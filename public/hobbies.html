<h1>Garrett Norwine's Hobbies</h1>
<p>Hobbies were hard to pick up during my time as a student. Now that I am graduted, I am beginning to explore my options.</p>
<p>My current hobbies are:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Weightlifting/fitness </b><br />
            I know, super original, but I truly enjoy it.</li>
        <li><b>Cooking/Baking </b><br />
            Especially with my fiance!</li>
        <li><b>Practicing HEMA/Fencing/Martial Arts </b><br />
            This is among friends and self-practice. I would love to get in a dojo though.</li>
        <li><b>Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs)</b><br />
            You've probably heard all about Dungeons and Dragons. I have been looking into other TTRPG systems too. I also enjoy a good regular board/card game!</li>
    </ul>
